# Password Strength Predictor Using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project builds a **machine learning model** that predicts the strength of a password (e.g., weak, medium, strong). With rising cybersecurity threats, predicting and classifying password strength is an important step toward improving security awareness.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing and feature engineering of password datasets.
- ML models to classify password strength.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of model performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
